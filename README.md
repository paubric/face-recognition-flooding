# Face Recognition Flooding
Flooding a face recognition system with a video consisting of synthetic faces. The flood clutters the collection of unique identities stored on the target system and reduces its recall for real identities.

# Flood Example
[This video](https://youtu.be/RXoiYqAJrD4) contains a sequence of around 10000 unique synthetic faces at 5 frames per second.
